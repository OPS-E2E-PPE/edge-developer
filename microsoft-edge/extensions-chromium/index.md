# Microsoft Edge (Chromium) Extensions  

Extensions are small programs that may be used to add new features to Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) or modify the existing functionality.  Extensions are intended to improve a user's day-to-day browsing experience by providing niche functionality that is important to targeted audiences.  

Microsoft Edge \(Chromium\) and Google Chrome share a common extension API model that is based on the open source Chromium engine, allowing you to submit the same source code bundle to the Microsoft and Google extension stores, and simplifying the extension publishing workflow.
